# zmodrepo

At the moment, this is a proof of concept that a zsh loadable module can be
written out of the zsh tree and in Rust. Eventually, the goal is to have a
module that can print repository information for Git and more importantly
Mercurial for the shell prompt much faster than any pure-shell implementation
like zsh's included `vcs_info` or whatever hideously slow method oh-my-zsh uses,
so the prompt can be drawn as quickly as possible and hopefully without a
percievable delay.  Using native code means that faster methods of gathering
repository information like libgit2 and Mercurial's command server facility can
be used. Forking a new process on every prompt is expensive, forking a new
_Python interpreter_ is even more expensive.

## Compile

I've been using Rust 1.38 so far, I'm not sure how low you can go but I know
that you need at least Rust 1.31 for Rust 2018 support. Apart from that you'll
need zsh's header files installed, they're in zsh-dev on Ubuntu/Debian.  The
usual cargo build instructions apply:
```
cargo build --release
```

## Install

At the moment, you'll need to move the shared library file yourself. Using
`~/zmods` as an example, add this to your `.zshenv`:

```
module_path=(~/zmods $module_path)
```

Copy the shared object from the `target/release` folder and name it without
the `lib` prefix:

```
cp target/release/libmodrepo.so ~/zmods/zmodrepo
```

Now you can load the module:

```
% zmodload zmodrepo
zmodrepo loaded
% rustexample
hello from rust!
```

(This is to say that it won't crash your shell, or release demons from your
laptop's fan exhaust.)

If you're brave you can unload the module:

```
% zmodload -u zmodrepo
zmodrepo unloaded
```

And that's it!
